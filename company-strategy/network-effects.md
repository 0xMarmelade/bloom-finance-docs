# ðŸ§² Network effects

Traditional Web2 provide services in exchange for personal data and thus experience the highest growth and profit when strong network effects (network effects account for 70% of value in Web2 tech firms) are in play \[2]. Companies such as Facebook experience exponential growth such as:

> $$[n(n-1)\; growth\; rate, \;where\; n = new\;user]$$

Thus it strengthens its moat when each new user signs up \[3]. However, the permissionless, open-nature of Web3 protocols means â€˜companiesâ€™ such as Bloom cannot rely on supply or demand side stakeholder lock-in \[4]. Bloom cannot rely on network effects, however, by creating high social and technical trust and forcing skin in the game (SITG) scenarios on its direct and indirect stakeholders Bloom can increase its moat and user stickiness.

Social trust is associated with the trust that the users have for the founders and developing team (will the team run once the protocol experiences mass adoption?) whereas technical trust refers to the trust associated with the actual technology (how many bugs are there?). Stakeholder SITG can be split into direct â€“ build commitment from the direct user base (can we ensure users are committed to Bloom?), and indirect â€“ build commitment and support from other network participants (can we have other protocols rely on Bloom?)**.**

Integrating the above-mentioned trust and SITG measures, Bloom will create the best possible network effects it could have in a Web3 environment. The biggest priority for Bloom and where most traction can be built is through direct stakeholder SITG. In essence, the business model already incorporates Ponzi theory (encouraging early adoption as supply decreases and asset price increases as adoption spread) and can efficiently create long-term governance reward structures as are present in many Web2 companies today (for example, Elon Muskâ€™s stock options) \[5],\[6].
