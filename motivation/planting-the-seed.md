# ðŸŒ± Planting the Seed

Web3 is rapidly growing and changing how we as humans interact, do business, and live. One key component of Web3 is the open-source nature of the platform. It openly incentivizes users to build on the shoulders of their predecessors. In Bloom's case, Klima.dao.&#x20;

We started with what Klima.dao had built and tried to replicate their protocol. It was important for us to understand just how the technology worked. We were able to successfully _fork_ Klima.dao and gauge an understanding of the underlying business model. This was presented to the class. Until that stage, the focus had been on rebuilding. But from the feedback, brainstorming sessions, and mentorship from Christian, we were able to develop and grow to new heights.&#x20;

Our main feedback will be covered later, but the key takeaways were to think about our user strategy - our [network effect](../company-strategy/network-effects.md). In addition to this, while in discussion with Christian, we developed the plan to target not just carbon credits, but all sustainable development goals. This was found to best be done through sustainable bonds.&#x20;

From this point, we researched the [market](broken-reference), the [financial structure ](broken-reference)of the protocol and developed our MVP.&#x20;

A **project fork** happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork\_\(software\_development\))]

**Sustainable bonds** are fixed-income financial instruments (bonds) where the proceeds will be exclusively used to finance or re-finance a combination of Green and Social Projects and which are aligned with the four core components of the [International Capital Market Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\_Capital\_Market\_Association) (ICMA) Green Bonds Principles and Social Bonds principles. \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability\_Bonds)]
