# How it works

### **Standing on the shoulder of giants**

**Bloom Finance** is a fork of Klima DAO, which was already a fork of the popular [Olympus DAO ](https://www.olympusdao.finance/)protocol. As such, the fundamentals of their monetary and economic policy are similar, with one key difference.&#x20;

Olympus DAO is a second generation decentralized finance (DeFi) project that emits a community-owned crypto-reserve currency, backed by real assets. By _reserve currency_, we mean that value is not created from thin air and speculated upon, but derived from a growing asset treasury accumulated by the community behind the project (a DAO). Hence, its goal is to offer a low-volatility, floor-priced currency to help grow and structure the DeFi ecosystem on more stable grounds. Klima and Bloom operate using similar dynamics, but with a twist.

While Olympus's token is backed by **1 USD**, KLIMA tokens are backed by 1 unit of [verified carbon units](https://verra.org/project/vcs-program/) (VCUs or VCSs), using a blockchain tokenized version of their _real-world_ counterpart. With Bloom, we aim to extend this idea of a carbon-based currency to the wider market of **sustainable & green bonds.**&#x20;

### Why does it work?

#### The Klima example

To explain the green virtuous cycle of our business model, let's take the working example of the existing Klima Protocol. Having only launched in october 2021, it has already acquired more than 13M tonnes of CO2, equivalent to removing 3M passenger vehicules for one year. Klima DAO aims to drive price appreciation of carbon credits __ by buying and hoarding as many credits as possible from the market and locking them away in its treasury. The project posits that this could lead to a supply squeeze for carbon credits, driving prices up.&#x20;

Pricier offsets could also result in crucial financing being channeled towards genuine sustainability projects which tackle our environmental issues. More expensive offsets also have the added effect of encouraging more climate-positive projects to emerge as it becomes more profitable to sell credits to the market.

Klima DAO’s founders argue that the perfect currency should be regenerative for our planet by _pricing in the cost of carbon_. Within Klima DAO’s model, more economic activity within the system increases the supply of KLIMA, which can only be minted when tokenized carbon is locked into its treasury. It may be hard for non ‘climate-natives’ to see how this backing is significant, but it becomes clearer when they realize that carbon (or specifically perhaps, how much carbon is in the atmosphere) is a proxy for important things such as climate stability or biodiversity. These are literally things that underpin life and society on earth as we know it.&#x20;

At the same time, individual environmental action such as shifting one’s diet to be more plant-based or flying less typically requires a sacrifice of convenience, and is not explicitly beneficial to those lacking an intrinsic motivation to perform them. Klima DAO provides a novel way in tying climate action directly to economic benefits for users - the more KLIMA tokens you own, the more carbon you’re locking away, and the more returns you’re making through staking. Klima DAO's goals of creating a currency backed by environmental regeneration instead of the exploitation of resources could create a massive shift in society’s view towards money.
