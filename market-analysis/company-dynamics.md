A comprehensive understanding of Bloom's internal environment is required to see where we may experience weaknesses and strengths. Therefore, a SWOT analysis was used to outline wherein the ecosystem Bloom would position itself.

Bloomâ€™s target market is difficult to estimate from the top-down method due to the uncertainty and volatility within the Web3 environment. Therefore, to gain an understanding of the potential, long-term market size, it is best to look at the protocols which came before Bloom â€“ Klima. Dao and Olympus. DAO. Klima asset flow equates to 13,100,974 tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of close to 131,009,740 USD. Olympus. Dao has a current locked value of 2,815,745,135 USD. As the addressable market shifts so rapidly it is better to base growth predictions on these two protocols. Therefore, Bloomâ€™s accessible market is assumed to be between **100 million and 3 billion USD.**

Our strategy is to build a strong user base through network effects. Increasing the user base increases the system's reliability and trustworthiness, both crucial aspects in the web3 ecosystem.
