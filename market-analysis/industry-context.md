# ðŸ’¸ Industry context

Bloom finds itself in a market that is rapidly growing and evolving. As the climate emergency is exacerbating and social injustice is re-emerging across the globe, investors are rethinking their portfolio strategies and progressively demand that their investments are mission-driven and align with social and ecologically conscious values. This trend has given rise to sustainable investing, a frame of mind with a trillion-dollar potential and a force for good. The Global Sustainable Investing Alliance (GSIA), the leading body on global sustainable investment has estimated global investments above 35.5 trillion USD in 2020, up from 23 trillion USD in 2016 \[1]. According to the GSIA, the industry is expected to continue growing rapidly in the future as the next generation of investors reaches maturity \[1].

The market is quite attractive due to its rapid evolution and adoption of decentralised finance technology (DeFi). Therefore, the threat of new entrants is high. DeFi protocols are often forced to be open source to build public and platform trust (see the section on network effects). This creates a market where substitution, new competition and the threat of new entrants is high. While this is an unattractive indicator, it means strategy needs to be focused on network effects and building an effective moat. Supplier and buyer bargaining power are obsolete for Bloom. Due to the mutualistic nature of the platform, it makes no sense for the supplier to force Bloom into an uncomfortable price point. Additionally, Bloom's customers are also its owners. What is good for them is good for the company.

**Based on Porterâ€™s 5 forces, Bloom needs to focus on network effects and building a reliable userbase. The strategy Bloom plans to use will be discussed in a later section.**
