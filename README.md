# ðŸŒ³ What is Bloom Finance?

**How impactful are your investments? Can they force greenwashing firms to do the right thing?**&#x20;

With Bloom, they will. Bloom is **a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform accelerating the price appreciation of social and green bonds**. The higher the price of these bonds, the more incentive there is for a company to act consciously as their **environmentally and socially detrimental operations become too costly to sustain**.

Currently, large global corporations operate under such complex standards that the internalization of their impact is impossible. With the removal of social and green bonds from the market, the price will naturally increase. This mechanism will cause the current operational policies of companies to become too expensive, thus catalysing a positive shift.



What we truly value, is not being valued by the market.
