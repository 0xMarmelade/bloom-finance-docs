# ‚Åâ For newcomers: How do I participate

{% hint style="danger" %}
**In order to understand how Bloom can be used concretely, we've reused this tutorial from KlimaDao (the open-source project from which bloom is inspired)**

{% hint style="info" %}
üëâ Please be aware that KLIMA exists only **on the blockchain.** You _and_ _only you_ are in control of your funds. If you are scammed, lose your password, make a bad trade, or send to the wrong address... there is nobody who can help you! KlimaDAO can not assume any responsibility.

Here are some measures you can take to keep yourself safe:

* Use another browser for crypto investments than you use for your daily browsing and only have one tab open in that browser at a time.
* Review this video for more information and background:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kcXVEDB64Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kcXVEDB64Y)
* Only use links from trustworthy sources - [klimadao.finance](http://klimadao.finance) and [klimadao.notion.site](http://klimadao.notion.site)
* Make sure your software and hardware wallets are up to date.

## Introduction

How can you participate in our ecosystem and become a "Klimate"? You have two options.

1.  **Staking -** Acquire KLIMA on the open market, and "stake it" to earn a share of the protocol's profit over time. Staking is a way of presenting ownership of your tokens to the protocol, and indicating that you don't plan to sell the KLIMA. In practice, you give us KLIMA and we give you sKLIMA tokens. sKLIMA tokens are like coupons that can be redeemed back for KLIMA at any time.

    and/or
2. **Bonding** - Deposit carbon and receive KLIMA at a discounted rate. The Treasury accepts carbon in the form of BCT tokens or Liquidity Pool tokens for BCT pairs (USDC/BCT & KLIMA/BCT).

Staking and Bonding both will be done at:[https://dapp.klimadao.finance](https://dapp.klimadao.finance)

_**For beginners, we recommend staking**_, also known as the (3,3) - or in our case the (üå≥,üå≥) strategy. This guide will walk you through acquiring KLIMA tokens, which can then be staked.

## **What do I need?**

In order to take part, you need to prepare a few things in advance. This short guide explains how, with links to Youtube videos that show exactly how it‚Äòs done. If you are new to Crypto, this might take you a while! We recommend using a desktop or laptop instead of your mobile phone.

### **1. Install Metamask wallet as a browser extension**

Metamask wallet is the most widely used wallet. A wallet is a cryptographic tool that lets you interact with the blockchain network securely. Install Metamask as a browser extension that is available for Chrome, Firefox, Brave and, Edge.

Use this link:[https://Metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)

Video tutorial on [how to install the Metamask extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afATAw7iuUM) for Chrome.

### **2. Add the Polygon Network to your Metamask extension**

Polygon is the network where KlimaDAO will be deployed at launch.

Head to our [dApp](https://dapp.klimadao.finance) and click "Connect Wallet".

A prompt should appear warning you that you are on the wrong network. Click the button that says **"Switch to mainnet"**.

Metamask will ask if you'd like to add the Polygon network (formerly called 'Matic' network). Confirm this, the network should appear, and the page should refresh.

If you want to learn more about networks and what they are for, [read this.](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404424659995)

### **3. Fund your wallet on the Polygon Network.**

**Your wallet address is the same on Polygon as it is on Ethereum.** However, transactions on Polygon require MATIC instead of ETH (to pay the network transaction fees). You need to fund your wallet with $1-2 USD worth‚Äî just a couple MATIC tokens.

You might also consider adding USDC to your wallet on the Polygon Network. You can use USDC tokens to swap for MATIC, BCT and KLIMA.

There are many possibilities to fund your Polygon wallet with MATIC or USDC. You could:

1. Bridge some of the tokens you already have on Ethereum.
2. Buy on a token exchange website.
3. Use an on-ramp service to buy directly with your credit card.

#### _**Option A: Bridge tokens from Ethereum to Polygon**_

If you have existing funds in a wallet on Ethereum, you can bridge them to your wallet on Polygon. NOTE: This can sometimes be expensive due to Ethereum's high network fees.

You can refer to [this guide on using the official Matic bridge](https://medium.com/stakingbits/guide-to-using-the-matic-bridge-to-bridge-tokens-from-ethereum-to-polygon-c3e66cf3d334).

Unless you bridge MATIC from Ethereum to Polygon directly, you still need some MATIC for gas fees on Polygon. You can use this [Swap for Gas](https://wallet.polygon.technology/swap/) utility to get your bridged ETH, DAI, Frax, or USDC tokens converted to MATIC on the Polygon PoS Network without paying for any gas fees.

Please note that a minimum of 1 MATIC and a maximum of 20 MATIC can be swapped at a time. Currently, with 1 MATIC, you will have enough gas to pay for almost 1000 transactions.

#### **Option B: Buy on a token exchange.**

**Example 1:** [**Crypto.com**](http://crypto.com)**:**

Here is a video tutorial on how to withdraw MATIC from [crypto.com](http://crypto.com):

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvuH5h61Gc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvuH5h61Gc)

**Example 2: Binance**

Go to your Fiat and Spot Wallet, look for Matic and click on Withdraw.

Key in your MetaMask wallet in the address bar and select ‚ÄúMATIC‚Äù in the network as shown below:

Take note that sometimes, Binance will suspend the network if it‚Äôs too congested so check if it‚Äôs available before buying Matic to withdraw out.

![](https://klimadao.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fbecf12a6-e87f-46f2-928f-25640edf72a4%2Fimage2.png?table=block\&id=472cb95d-84de-4cf8-8239-988ade0e7345\&spaceId=0e3b507a-ec55-4ab0-8f14-67c57090b1cf\&width=1060\&userId=\&cache=v2)

**Example 3: OKEx**

OKEx allows the direct withdrawal of MATIC to the Polygon network.

**Example 4: Coinbase**

Coinbase does not allow buying into Polygon directly, only Ethereum. So you need to purchase USDC, send it to your Metamask Ethereum wallet, use the polygon Bridge to move them to the Polygon network (for a fee).

Note that coinbase sometimes applies several days long holding period before you can send funds to another wallet.

#### **Option C: Fiat-on-ramp**

Use something like [Transak](https://global.transak.com/) to buy directly with your credit card for a fee. **Be sure to select Polygon as your target network!**

You can find a list of other available options and more information [from the polygon website.](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/fiat-on-ramp/)

### **4. Buy KLIMA directly on Sushiswap.**

Great, by now you should have a few MATIC tokens, and some USDC in your wallet on the Polygon network. It's time to buy some KLIMA tokens.

Sushiswap platform is home to the official trading pools where everyone buys and sells their KLIMA and BCT tokens.

Go to[https://sushi.com/](https://sushi.com/) and click on ‚ÄúEnter App‚Äù. Connect your MetaMask wallet. On the right top corner, you will now see the network you are working in. It should say Polygon. If not, change the network in your Metamask to Polygon.

Click on the left upper corner on ‚ÄúSwap‚Äú and then choose the token you want to ‚ÄúSwap from‚Äù and then enter `**0x4e78011ce80ee02d2c3e649fb657e45898257815**` (token address of KLIMA) in the ‚ÄúSwap To (est.):‚Äù field to select KLIMA.

Enter the number of tokens you‚Äôre looking to swap to or from and click Approve.

You should get a popup from your Metamask to confirm the first transaction. After which, the button will be changed to ‚ÄúSwap‚Äù, which you will click on to confirm the transaction which will give you another popup from MetaMask to confirm. Once submitted, wait for your transaction to be confirmed.

![](https://klimadao.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F62abada8-04ec-42d0-90d6-5e6d7d1f8fc1%2Fimage1.png?table=block\&id=e9d365e7-1872-47d6-bdfa-71675b7c5dfd\&spaceId=0e3b507a-ec55-4ab0-8f14-67c57090b1cf\&width=1400\&userId=\&cache=v2)

**Congratulations, you now own KLIMA tokens.**

### 5. Alternative: **Bond LP to receive KLIMA**

To secure Klima at a discount, instead of buying directly from a pool, you can instead bond KLIMA/BCT and BCT/USDC LP tokens with the treasury. This is one of the ways the KLIMA treasury absorbs carbon credits.

To do this you need to add liquidity for your pair in the LP pools on Sushiswap on Polygon. You can find instructions [here](https://docs.sushi.com/products/amm-exchange/liquidity-pools) on providing liquidity for Sushiswap.

After providing liquidity to a liquidity pool, ‚ÄúLP tokens‚Äù are sent to the wallet that provided the liquidity. It is these tokens that can be bonded with the Protocol at[https://dapp.klimadao.finance/#/bonds](https://dapp.klimadao.finance/#/bonds)

### 6\*\*. Stake Klima\*\*

Stake your KLIMA on[https://klimadao.finance](https://klimadao.finance) to (üå≥,üå≥).

Just click "STAKE" and choose how much KLIMA to stake in exchange for sKLIMA coupons. You can always trade back your sKLIMA for KLIMA. But remember, interest is compounding, so the longer you stay staked, the better!
