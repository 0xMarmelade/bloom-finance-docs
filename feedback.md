# ðŸ’¬ Feedback

OBSERVATION:mag:: Due to the specialized nature and technical complexity of the business model, our operational communication was not easily digestible for attendees not too familiar with crypto.

FUTURE ACTION:exclamation:: Enticing a wide range of actors to invest in Bloom outside the crypto community, may require the integration of tools to better educate new users and build their trust.

OBSERVATION:mag:: Since Bloom aims to leverage stakeholder mechanisms and network effects to gather momentum, some attendees were curious about how we plan on retaining users over time.

FUTURE ACTION:exclamation:: Creating a strong community of investors over time may require developing a clear incentive framework, favouring user retention and allowing the platform to grow in value.

OBSERVATION:mag:: How will the platform gain initial traction and insert itself into the market?

FUTURE ACTION:exclamation:: Bloom will position itself in a way that it can benefit from synergies and feedback loops in the ecosystem of sustainable DeFi and develop strategic partnerships.
