# Cost Structure

Bloom does not follow traditional cost structures or goals. As **profits are not a key objective** for the platform, they are **all reinvested**. The main goal is to **accumulate and store green and social bonds**. Due to the decentralized, customer-owned nature of web3 protocols, **the cost structure weighs heavily on variable costs**. Costs accounted for to predict Blooms value and cash flow are:

<summary><strong>Transaction cost approximated by the cost of electricity</strong></summary>

In Q2 2022, the Ethereum blockchain (Polygon) will implement proof of stake (PoS) validation, turning off proof of work (PoW) for good. This will reduce energy requirements by approximately 99.95% to **0.1667kWh/s** (irrespective of transaction quantity) a comparative 0.1% of the energy expenditure of Visa \[7], \[8]. As Bloom can be launched today, PoW energy costs will be applied until Q2 2022 (**333.4kWh/s**) \[7]. To determine an accurate cost of electricity, mining weights per country were multiplied by country Levelized cost of electricity (LCoE) The weighted average for 2021 was **0.108 USD/kWh** \[9], \[10]. Polygon can process 10,000 – 100,000 transactions per minute. Therefore, with initial transactions assumed at 50,000 per quarter, 1 minute of transaction is used. Note this is a high-level assumption used to price in transaction costs (pretty much negligible) \[10].

<summary>Real inflation rate</summary>

Real inflation was taken at a random (to build in economic uncertainty) value between **3.0% and 3.5% per annum** based on historical global trends \[11].

<summary>Cost of bonds</summary>

Blooms focus lies on green and social bonds. Through technical analysis, future price predictions are made for two major green and social bonds (**CABEI.SIX  @ 108USD2021 and BGRN.NASDAQ @ 55USD2021**) \[12],\[13] .  The growth rate of the bonds is based on historical values. Randomised growth within historical variance is applied **CABEI: -0.65% to 0.97% and BGRN: -15.88% to 9.80% per quarter**.

<summary>Smart contract security audits</summary>

An audit pulse cost is applied at **months 3, 6, 9, 15 and 24**. Audits are staggered to align with the development of the platform. Trust building and crucial at the beginning of the project. The price per audit is approximated at **200,000USD2021** based on quartile one audit prices for financial institutions \[14].

<summary>Financial insurance</summary>

Social and technical trust relies heavily on system security and are the major network drivers for a Web3 protocol. Therefore, ensuring a high level of financial insurance and security is crucial to building a successful platform. Insurance – **15% of each dollar invested is placed into a treasury.** Security cost is based on current Web2 security cost estimates **– 5000USD2021** per month. Due to the added uncertainty of the Web3 platform, an extra 50% is added on top.

<summary>Others</summary>

As not all costs can accurately be predicted at this point, an **extra 7.5% is added** to all expenses.
